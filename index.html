            <p>Life goals are all the things you want to accomplish in your life. Often your life goals are very meaningful to you and can make a lasting impact on your life. They can be large and challenging goals, or they can be smaller and more personal. It all depends on what you want to achieve.</p>

                <h3>MISSION</h3>
                <p>I’ve met at least a few people who have this as a life goal. This is a great example of a life goal that takes real dedication, especially if you’re not a runner yet.
                That’s because a half marathon is about 21 kilometers (13.1 miles). </p>

                <h3>VISSION</h3>
                <p>That’s a whole lotta miles. Training is something that needs to happen steadily, every day or several times a week. It’s definitely not for the faint of heart. But the reward is as hefty as the commitment.</p>
